        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>I experimented with lots of recipes over the years to find the best crispy fried chicken. This is it! It's bits and pieces of hints I have heard over the years. It's more a matter of preparation and cooking method!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>30 saltine crackers</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon seasoned salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground pepper</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>6 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
            <li>2 cups vegetable oil for frying</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place crackers in a large resealable plastic bag; seal bag and crush crackers with a rolling pin until they are coarse crumbs. Add the flour, potato flakes, seasoned salt, and pepper and mix well.</li>
            <li>Beat egg in a shallow dish or bowl. One by one, dredged chicken pieces in egg, then place in bag crumb mixture. Seal bag and shake to coat.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F(175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Fry chicken, turning frequently, until golden brown and juices run clear, 15 to 50 minutes.</li>
            
        </ol>
